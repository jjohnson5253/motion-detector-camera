# motion-detector-camera
Built with Arduino Uno, Raspberry Pi 2, and Python 3, this project functions as a motion detecting security camera. This was created for a course in Programming Digital Systems. A simple motion sensor is attached to an Arduino which, when triggered, awakes the Arduino from sleep. The Arduino then tells the Raspberry Pi to wake up, capture an image with the Picamera and save it to a microSD card.
